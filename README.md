# SpotItForMe

## How It Works:
you can run the program by running the following command in the terminal -> python3 Spotitforme.py

when you run this command the SpotItForMe script will run and ask you series of input to get the playlist started.

After you have finished inputing the asked inputs, any tweet around you with the format of 'chosen_hashtag , artist - song' will be picked by by the script and the songs is added to your playlist.

The program will sleep for 10 minutes, then it will promt you If you want to continue with the search, and if you choose to do so then the whole process of search and adding will repeat until you tell it to not to do so.
